The file sampleInput.txt is the input file for exe, and the file stackInput.txt is the input file for stack_exe.

The file Finalresult.txt stores the final linkedlist produced after performing various operations by exe.

The files driver.c and stack_driver.c are the driver files containing main functions for linkedlist and stack operations respectively.
