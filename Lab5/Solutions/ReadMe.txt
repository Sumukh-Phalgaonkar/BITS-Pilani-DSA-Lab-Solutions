The header file bank.h declares all the methods necessary for implemeting the recursive insertion sort as well as for reading the data from file.
These functions are defined in bank.c
The time taken for reading the data from file is stored in readtime.txt
The time takne by insertion sort is stored in Insertionsort_time.txt
The stack space used is stored in stackspace.txt

The Inputs were given in following order 10,100,500,1000,1500,5000,10000,15000,20000 and 100000.
On giving input of 200000 the OS terminated the program.

The tables and graphs are available in Graphs and Calculatins .xlsx.

The Screenshots of graphs are also attached.
In all the graphs, the size of input is taken on x-axis.

Thank You.
